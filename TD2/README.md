We study the following game. We have a rectangular grid on which we can place and move fruit. Each square on the grid can only contain one fruit. There are several types of fruit. As soon as at least three fruits of the same type are adjacent in a row or column, they are eliminated and disappear from the grid. The player receives points based on the number of fruits eliminated.

Given the dimensions of the grid and the number of types of fruit, we seek to count the stable configurations, that is to say the configurations where there are never three fruits of the same type adjacent in a line or in a column. These are the configurations where no fruit is eliminated.

The objective of the tutorial is to count the number of stable configurations on a 10x10 grid with two types of fruit.
