# K-Dimensional Trees (kd-trees) üå≥

This topic explores **k-dimensional trees (kd-trees)**, a data structure designed to efficiently find the **closest neighbor** of a given point within a set of points in \( \mathbb{R}^k \).

---

## What is a kd-tree? üìñ

- **Kd trees** are similar to binary search trees but differ in how they distribute nodes:
  - The sorting criterion alternates between the \( k \) coordinates based on the depth of a node \( n \) in the tree.
  - This alternation ensures efficient organization and querying in multi-dimensional space.

## How kd-trees Work üõ†Ô∏è

1. **Construction**:
   - At each level, points are split based on one of their \( k \)-coordinates.
   - The splitting dimension cycles through the \( k \) dimensions as you move down the tree.

2. **Nearest Neighbor Search**:
   - Kd-trees allow for efficient searching of the point closest to a given query point by narrowing the search space recursively.

## Application üöÄ

### Color Quantization in Images üé®
- **Color Representation**:
  - Images typically use **24-bit color encoding**, with 8 bits each for **red**, **green**, and **blue**, corresponding to a point in \( \mathbb{R}^3 \).
  
- **GIF Compression**:
  - To compress an image into the GIF format:
    - Select **256 colors** from **16,777,216 possible colors** to represent the image.
    - Predefined palettes, like the web palette, often yield poor results.
    - Instead, the palette must be **adapted to the image**, choosing colors that best match its unique distribution.

- **Kd-tree Advantage**:
  - Using a kd-tree to efficiently find the closest color in the palette for each pixel allows for high-quality color quantization and compression.

## Why kd-trees? ü§î

- **Efficiency**:
  - Reduces the time complexity of nearest neighbor search compared to brute force.
- **Versatility**:
  - Can be applied to various multi-dimensional data, not limited to image processing.
