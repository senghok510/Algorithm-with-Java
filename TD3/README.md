# Hex Game Programming 🟦🔴

This topic focuses on programming the **Hex game**, a two-player strategy game.

---

## Game Overview 🎲

- **Players**: Two players, called **Red** and **Blue**.
- **Board**: A diamond-shaped board made up of hexagonal squares. The board size is flexible but typically **11×11**.
- **Edges**:
  - Red owns one pair of opposite edges.
  - Blue owns the other pair of opposite edges.

## Rules of the Game 🛠️

1. **Gameplay**:
   - **Red goes first.**
   - Players take turns claiming empty hexagonal squares on the board and marking them with their color.

2. **Objective**:
   - A player wins by connecting their two opposite edges with a continuous chain of adjacent squares of their color.

## Programming Objectives 🎯

The goal of this topic is to program a simulation of the Hex game, including:
1. **Board Representation**:
   - Design a data structure to represent the diamond-shaped hexagonal grid.
2. **Gameplay Implementation**:
   - Allow two players (human or AI) to take turns marking squares.
   - Ensure that turns and moves follow the rules.
3. **Winning Condition**:
   - Implement an algorithm to determine if a player has successfully connected their two edges.
4. **Optional Enhancements**:
   - Add an AI player with strategies to play against humans.
   - Allow for varying board sizes.

## Challenges 🚧

- **Graph Algorithms**:
  - The problem of checking for a winning path is equivalent to finding a connected path in a graph.
- **Efficiency**:
  - Optimizing the check for winning conditions on larger boards.
- **User Interface**:
  - Building an intuitive interface for players to visualize the board and make moves.
