This topic covers Hex game programming.

Hex is a game for two players, called Red and Blue. It is played on a diamond-shaped board paved with hexagonal squares, of free size, but typically 11Ã—11. Each player has two opposite edges of the board. Red goes first. Players take turns taking empty squares on the board, marking them with their colors. The first player who manages to connect his two edges by a series of adjacent squares of his color wins the game.
