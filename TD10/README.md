# Shortest Path Problem in Graphs üåê

 we focus on the problem of computing the **shortest path** in a graph. This problem is commonly encountered in GPS software, which needs to calculate road routes efficiently.  

When dealing with large graphs, it is essential to use performant algorithms to compute the shortest paths in a time acceptable to the user. This is especially true for road networks, which correspond to graphs with hundreds of thousands (or even millions) of vertices.
In this project, we use Dijkstra/Bidijkstra algorithme to solve that.
