# Battle: A Card Game Simulation ‚ô†Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô£Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è

**Battle** is a simple card game for two players. The objective of this tutorial is to create a program that simulates the game, determines the winner, or identifies if the game ends in a draw.

## Game Rules üÉè

1. **Setup**:
   - The 52 cards are shuffled and divided into two equal decks, one for each player.
   - Each player begins with a deck of 26 cards.

2. **Gameplay**:
   - Players play the top card from their respective decks in each round.
   - The outcome of the round is determined by the rank of the cards:
     - The player with the higher card takes both cards and adds them to the bottom of their deck.
     - If the cards are of equal rank, the round results in a draw, and both cards are discarded.

3. **Endgame**:
   - The game ends when one player has all the cards, or after a predefined number of rounds (to prevent infinite games).
   - The winner is the player with more cards at the end of the game.

4. **Outcome**:
   - The program determines the winner or declares a draw if both players have an equal number of cards.

## Objective üéØ

The goal of this tutorial is to:
1. **Shuffle the Cards**: Randomly distribute the 52 cards into two equal decks.
2. **Simulate the Game**: Play through the rounds based on the rules.
3. **Determine the Winner**: Indicate whether Player 1, Player 2, or neither (a draw) wins the game.

This simulation provides an excellent way to practice programming concepts like **randomization**, **data structures** (queues for decks), and **control flow**.
